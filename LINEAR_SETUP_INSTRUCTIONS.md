# Linear Setup Instructions

**Created:** January 31, 2025  
**Purpose:** Step-by-step guide to import all Proofound issues into Linear

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Get Your Linear API Key

1. Go to [Linear Settings â†’ API](https://linear.app/settings/api)
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Copy the key (it looks like: `lin_api_xxxxxxxxxxxxx`)
4. **Important:** Save it securely - you won't be able to see it again!

### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variable

**Option A: Export in Terminal (Temporary)**
```bash
export LINEAR_API_KEY="lin_api_xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

**Option B: Add to .env.local (Permanent)**
```bash
# Add this line to your .env.local file
LINEAR_API_KEY=lin_api_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Step 3: Run the Import Script

```bash
# Install dependencies (one-time)
npm install node-fetch dotenv

# Run the import script
node scripts/import-linear-issues.mjs
```

That's it! The script will:
- âœ… Create all labels
- âœ… Create all completed issues (marked as Done)
- âœ… Create all in-progress issues
- âœ… Create all backlog issues
- âœ… Set proper priorities, estimates, and labels

---

## ðŸ“‹ What Gets Created

### Labels (40+ labels)
- Status labels: `completed`, `in-progress`, `todo`, `blocked`
- Priority labels: `priority-p0` through `priority-p3`
- Epic labels: `epic-1` through `epic-10`
- Type labels: `taxonomy`, `matching`, `ui`, `api`, `database`, etc.
- Component labels: `individual`, `organization`, `shared`

### Issues Created

**âœ… Completed Work (12 issues)**
- Next.js Setup
- Design System
- Database Schema
- Supabase Integration
- Authentication Flow
- Auth Redesign
- Email Templates
- Dashboards (Individual & Organization)
- Profile Components
- Matching System

**ðŸš§ In Progress (7 issues)**
- Individual Setup Form
- Organization Setup Form
- Password Reset Flow
- Email Verification
- Accept Invite Page
- Essential UI Components
- Middleware Guards

**ðŸ“‹ Backlog (6 Epic 1 issues)**
- E1-US1: Design & Seed L1 Categories
- E1-US2: Define L2 & L3 Subcategories
- E1-US3: Populate L4 Skills
- E1-US4: Implement Skill Embeddings
- E1-US5: Update Existing Skills Table
- E1-US6: Skills Taxonomy API Endpoints

**Total: 25 issues** (from LINEAR_ORGANIZATION_PLAN.md)

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Error: "LINEAR_API_KEY environment variable not set"

**Solution:** Make sure you've exported the API key:
```bash
export LINEAR_API_KEY="your_key_here"
# Then run the script again
```

### Error: "No teams found"

**Solution:** Create a team in Linear first:
1. Go to Linear â†’ Settings â†’ Teams
2. Create a new team (e.g., "Engineering")
3. Run the script again

### Error: "Failed to create label"

**Solution:** Labels might already exist. The script will skip existing labels and continue.

### Error: "GraphQL errors"

**Solution:** Check that your API key is valid and has proper permissions. You may need to regenerate it.

## ðŸŽ¨ After Import: Organize Your Workspace

### 1. Create Projects (Optional)

In Linear, create these projects to organize issues:

- **Proofound MVP** - Current sprint work
- **Skills Taxonomy** - Epic 1 work
- **Matching System** - Epic 2-7 work
- **Infrastructure** - DevOps and maintenance

Then assign issues to projects manually.

### 2. Create Epics (Recommended)

For each Epic (E1-E10), create an Epic issue and link related user stories to it:

1. Create Epic: "Epic 1: Skills Taxonomy System"
2. Link issues: E1-US1, E1-US2, E1-US3, etc.
3. Set epic's estimate to sum of child issues (55 pts for E1)

### 3. Set Up Sprint Board

1. Create a new sprint in Linear
2. Add critical blockers to Sprint 1:
   - Individual Setup Form (8 pts)
   - Organization Setup Form (8 pts)
   - Password Reset Flow (5 pts)
   - Email Verification (3 pts)
   - Accept Invite Page (5 pts)
   - Complete Middleware (8 pts)
   - Essential UI Components (13 pts)

**Total Sprint 1:** ~50 points (prioritize top 4-5)

---

## ðŸ“Š Next Steps

After importing:

1. âœ… Review all issues in Linear
2. âœ… Assign issues to team members
3. âœ… Create sprint and add issues
4. âœ… Set up projects for organization
5. âœ… Create Epic issues and link user stories
6. âœ… Start Sprint 1!

---

## ðŸ”„ Re-running the Script

If you need to run the script again:

- **Labels:** Will be skipped if they already exist
- **Issues:** Will create duplicates if run again (Linear doesn't check for duplicates)
- **Recommendation:** Only run once, or delete issues first if re-running

---

## ðŸ’¡ Alternative: Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up Linear manually:

1. Use `LINEAR_ORGANIZATION_PLAN.md` as your guide
2. Create labels one by one
3. Create issues one by one
4. Copy/paste from the plan document

This will take ~30-60 minutes vs. 2 minutes with the script.

## ðŸ†˜ Need Help?

If you encounter issues:

1. Check that your API key is valid
2. Ensure you have a team created in Linear
3. Check the error message for specific details
4. Verify your `.env.local` file has the correct format
