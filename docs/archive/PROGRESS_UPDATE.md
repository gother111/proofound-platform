## 🎯 What's Left (Remaining ~15% of MVP)

### Priority 1: Auth Pages (2-3 hours)

Currently: Login and signup work, but missing:

- [ ] `/reset-password` - Request password reset
- [ ] `/reset-password/confirm` - Set new password
- [ ] `/verify-email` - Verify email token
- [ ] Wire up actual email sending in auth flow

### Priority 2: Landing Page Enhancements (2-3 hours)

Currently: Basic structure exists, needs:

- [ ] Hero section with animations
- [ ] Problem/Solution sections
- [ ] For Individuals / For Organizations sections
- [ ] Principles section
- [ ] FAQ accordion
- [ ] Footer with links
- [ ] Framer Motion animations (scroll-triggered)

### Priority 3: Testing (Before Production - 3-4 hours)

- [ ] E2E test: Signup → Onboarding → Profile access
- [ ] E2E test: Create org → Invite → Accept
- [ ] E2E test: RLS policies prevent cross-org access
- [ ] Accessibility audit with axe-core
- [ ] Manual testing on mobile devices

### Optional (Nice-to-Have):

- [ ] Theme toggle (light/dark mode)
- [ ] Language switcher UI (en/sv)
- [ ] Avatar upload component
- [ ] Rich text editor for bio/mission
- [ ] Organization logo upload
- [ ] Email notifications (for real)
