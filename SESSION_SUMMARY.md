## 🎯 Critical Path to Launch

To get to a working MVP that users can sign up and use:

### Priority 1: Complete Onboarding (Est: 2-3 hours)

**Why**: Users can't access the app without completing onboarding
**Tasks**:

1. Build `IndividualSetup.tsx` form component
   - Display name, handle, headline, bio inputs
   - Form validation with Zod
   - Call `completeOnboarding` server action
   - Redirect to `/i/home`

2. Build `OrganizationSetup.tsx` form component
   - Org name, slug, type inputs
   - Optional: team invite emails
   - Call `completeOnboarding` server action
   - Redirect to `/o/[slug]/home`

3. Test full flow: signup → onboarding → app access

### Priority 2: Auth Flows (Est: 1-2 hours)

**Why**: Users need password recovery
**Tasks**:

1. `/reset-password` - Request reset link page
2. `/reset-password/confirm` - New password page
3. `/verify-email` - Email verification page
4. Wire up email sending in auth actions

### Priority 3: Accept Invite (Est: 1 hour)

**Why**: Organization invite flow won't work without this
**Tasks**:

1. `/o/[slug]/invitations/[token]/page.tsx`
2. Token validation
3. Accept → create membership
4. Redirect to org dashboard

### Priority 4: Error Handling (Est: 1 hour)

**Why**: Better user experience
**Tasks**:

1. Global `error.tsx` boundary
2. Global `not-found.tsx` page
3. Org-specific error pages

### Priority 5: Essential UI Components (Est: 2 hours)

**Why**: Needed for polished UX
**Tasks**:

1. Select component (for dropdowns)
2. Dialog component (for modals)
3. Toast component (for notifications)
4. Badge component (for status)

### Priority 6: Testing (Est: 3-4 hours)

**Why**: Ensure reliability before launch
**Tasks**:

1. E2E test: signup → onboarding → profile
2. E2E test: create org → invite → accept
3. E2E test: RLS policies working
4. Accessibility audit with axe-core

**Total Estimate to Production-Ready: ~12-15 hours of focused development**

2. Configure database (run SQL scripts)
3. Get API keys (Supabase + Resend)
4. Set up `.env.local`
5. Install and run: `npm install && npm run dev`

### Development Flow

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Make changes to schema
# Edit src/db/schema.ts

# Generate migration
npm run db:generate

# Apply migration
npm run db:migrate

# Open database viewer
npm run db:studio

# Type check
npm run typecheck

# Build
npm run build
```

## 🎨 Design System

### Colors

- **Primary**: Forest Green (#1C4D3A) - trust, growth
- **Background**: Parchment (#F7F6F1) - warmth, calm
- **Accent**: Terracotta (#C76B4A) - action, connection
- **Neutral Dark**: Stone Charcoal (#2D3330)
- **Neutral Light**: Warm Stone (#E8E6DD)

### Typography

- **Display** (H1-H3): Crimson Pro (serif)
- **Body** (UI, H4-H6): Inter (sans-serif)
- **Scale**: 12px-48px modular (1.2 ratio)

### Motion

- **Easing**: `cubic-bezier(0.33, 1, 0.68, 1)` for exits
- **Philosophy**: Calm, purposeful, respects reduced-motion

All tokens are in `src/design/` and integrated into Tailwind config.

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. ⚠️ Onboarding forms not complete - users can't finish onboarding yet
2. ⚠️ Password reset pages missing - users can't recover accounts
3. ⚠️ Email verification not wired up - emails sent but no handler page
4. ⚠️ Accept invite page missing - org invites can't be accepted yet
5. ⚠️ No error boundaries - errors crash the page
6. ⚠️ No toast notifications - no user feedback for actions
7. ⚠️ Mobile nav not optimized - works but could be better
8. ℹ️ Landing page basic - needs animations and better copy
9. ℹ️ No tests yet - manual testing only

**None of these are blockers for local development**, but they need to be addressed before production launch.
