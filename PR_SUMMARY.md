# Fix: Route Conflict Resolution and Domain Setup

## 🐛 Problem
Vercel deployment was failing with route conflict error:
```
You cannot have two parallel pages that resolve to the same path. 
Please check /(admin)/dashboard/page and /(organization)/dashboard/page
```

## ✅ Solution
- Renamed admin routes to avoid conflicts:
  - `(admin)/dashboard` → `(admin)/admin`
  - `(admin)/moderation` → `(admin)/admin-moderation`
- Moved organization dashboard from `(organization)/dashboard` → `/organization`
- Added custom domain setup documentation

## 🚀 Deployment Status
- ✅ All route conflicts resolved
- ✅ Build passes locally
- ✅ Domain `proofound.io` configured in Vercel
- ✅ Ready for production deployment

## 📝 Changes
- Fixed route conflicts in admin and organization routes
- Added `DOMAIN_SETUP.md` documentation
- Updated navigation links to point to new routes

## 🧪 Testing
- [x] Build completes successfully
- [x] No route conflicts
- [x] Navigation links updated
- [ ] Domain deployment verification (pending Vercel)
