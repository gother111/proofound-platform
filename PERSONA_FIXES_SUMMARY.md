# Persona Flow Fixes - Implementation Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Removed Duplicate Persona Validation

**File**: `src/actions/auth.ts`

- Removed redundant validation that checked persona before normalization (lines 87-95)
- Now only uses the clean normalization logic that maps 'organization' → 'org_member'
- Cleaner code with single source of validation through Zod schema

### 2. ✅ Created Persona Metadata Backfill Migration

**File**: `drizzle/0026_backfill_persona_metadata.sql`

- New migration to sync persona from `profiles.persona` to `auth.users.raw_user_meta_data`
- Ensures existing users have metadata for future operations
- Only updates users where persona is not 'unknown' and metadata is missing
- Migration has been applied successfully to the database

### 3. ✅ Fixed Onboarding Redirect Loop

**File**: `src/app/onboarding/page.tsx`

- Changed line 65 from `redirect('/signup')` to `return <OnboardingClient initialPersona={null} />`
- Prevents infinite loop: signup → onboarding → signup → ...
- Users with unknown persona now see the persona choice UI instead of being redirected

### 4. ✅ Enhanced Database Trigger Robustness

**Files**: `src/db/triggers.sql` + Applied to database

- Updated `handle_new_user()` trigger function
- Now uses `COALESCE(NULLIF(TRIM(...)), 'unknown')` for safer persona extraction
- Handles null, empty strings, and whitespace gracefully
- Trigger has been updated in the live database

### 5. ✅ Added Profile Creation Fallback

**File**: `src/actions/auth.ts` (after line 149)

- Added safety check after successful signup
- Verifies profile was created by trigger
- Creates profile manually if trigger failed
- Includes console warning for debugging
- Ensures no user is left without a profile

## Testing Checklist

### For New Signups

- [ ] Sign up as Individual → verify `persona='individual'` in both metadata and profiles
- [ ] Sign up as Organization → verify `persona='org_member'` in both places
- [ ] Verify email confirmation flow works correctly
- [ ] Check redirect after email verification goes to correct dashboard

### For Existing Users

- [ ] Login with demo users → verify no redirect loop to onboarding
- [ ] Check existing users can access their dashboards
- [ ] Verify middleware correctly protects persona-specific routes

### For Onboarding

- [ ] Access `/onboarding` with unknown persona → verify persona choice appears
- [ ] Complete individual onboarding → verify redirect to `/app/i/home`
- [ ] Complete organization onboarding → verify redirect to `/app/o/{slug}/home`

## Database State

### Before Fixes

```sql
-- Demo users had no persona metadata
SELECT email, raw_user_meta_data->>'persona' FROM auth.users;
-- Result: All NULL
```

### After Fixes

- Trigger updated to handle edge cases
- Migration ready to backfill when users have valid personas
- New signups will have correct metadata from the start

## Architecture Improvements

1. **Single Normalization Point**: Persona mapping happens once in signUp action
2. **Defensive Programming**: Trigger handles null/empty/whitespace gracefully
3. **Fallback Safety**: Manual profile creation if trigger fails
4. **No Redirect Loops**: Onboarding shows UI instead of redirecting
5. **Type Safety**: Zod schema validates persona values

## Files Modified

- ✅ `src/actions/auth.ts` - Removed duplicate validation, added profile fallback
- ✅ `src/app/onboarding/page.tsx` - Fixed redirect loop
- ✅ `src/db/triggers.sql` - Enhanced trigger robustness
- ✅ `drizzle/0026_backfill_persona_metadata.sql` - New migration (applied)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Testing

1. Create a new test user as Individual
2. Create a new test user as Organization
3. Verify both can login and reach correct dashboards
4. Test onboarding flow for users without persona

### Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Add persona change audit trail in `audit_logs`
- Create persona migration feature (individual → organization)
- Add comprehensive E2E tests for persona flows
- Create shared `Persona` type for type safety across codebase

## Known Limitations

- Existing demo users still have `persona='unknown'` in profiles
  - They will go through onboarding on next login
  - This is expected behavior for legacy users
  - Once they complete onboarding, they'll have correct persona

## Success Criteria

✅ No duplicate validation logic
✅ Trigger handles edge cases
✅ No redirect loops
✅ Profile creation is guaranteed
✅ Migration applied successfully
✅ All code changes implemented
