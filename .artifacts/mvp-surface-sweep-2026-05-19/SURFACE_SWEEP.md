# Proofound MVP Surface Sweep - 2026-05-19

## Scope

Goal: sweep, polish, improve, and fix launch-relevant MVP surfaces against the locked proof-first hiring corridor.

## UI Thesis Before Edits

Visual thesis: preserve Proofound's calm, credible proof-first identity while making primary route intent unmistakable. Public CTAs should behave as real links, not only JavaScript callbacks.

Content plan: keep language close to MVP objects and actions: proof portfolio, Proof Packs, assignments, verification, trust, consent, and review. Avoid old project, expertise atlas, analytics, and broad dashboard language.

Interaction thesis: every public or dashboard action should either route to an active MVP surface, stay gated, or fail closed. Stale links to archived routes are launch risk.

## Surface Matrix

| Family             | Representative surfaces checked                                                                                                     | Classification                        | Result                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Public/logged-out  | `/`, `/signup`, `/signup/individual`, `/signup/organization`, `/login`, `/portfolio/demo`                                           | Active MVP or launch-safe unavailable | Landing CTAs now route as links. Demo portfolio remains launch-safe unavailable.                                                                                         |
| Individual app     | `/onboarding`, `/app/i/portfolio`, `/app/i/verifications`, `/app/i/communications`, `/app/i/settings/privacy`                       | Active MVP, auth-gated                | Stale unauthenticated tests now target active protected routes. Proof-first onboarding and Proof Pack anchor integrity reruns passed focused tests and Browser evidence. |
| Organization app   | `/app/o/[slug]/assignments` and assignment-oriented dashboard entry                                                                 | Active MVP, auth/org-gated            | ProjectsCard no longer fetches archived project APIs and links orgs to assignments.                                                                                      |
| Internal/admin/ops | `/admin`, `/admin/verification`, `/admin/audit`, launch route inventories, archived API handlers, middleware archive policy         | Internal launch ops                   | Route inventory and admin UI tests pass. Broader admin users/fairness/analytics tests were removed from the active launch signal. No public diagnostics expanded.        |
| Archived/post-MVP  | Expertise Atlas, fairness note, team coverage analytics, legacy integration edge flows, broad admin users/fairness/metrics surfaces | Archive/post-MVP                      | Active E2E/unit discovery no longer runs these as launch expectations. Archive READMEs explain why.                                                                      |
| Cross-cutting      | CTA routing, route-surface policy tests, stale docs/tests, Browser desktop/mobile smoke                                             | Active launch readiness               | Focused tests and Browser checks completed. Docs freshness now passes with no findings after registering the remaining artifact/audit docs.                              |

## Findings Fixed

1. Landing CTAs were visually primary but some were JS-only buttons. Browser showed "Create your proof portfolio" did not navigate from `/`.
   - Fixed by converting repeated landing hero CTAs to real anchors:
     - `Request a pilot` -> `/signup/organization`
     - `Create your proof portfolio` -> `/signup/individual`
   - Fixed header `Start` -> `/signup` and `Request a pilot` -> `/signup/organization` as real links.

2. ProjectsCard carried archived project API assumptions.
   - Removed automatic fetches to `/api/projects?limit=5` and `/api/organizations/:id/projects`.
   - Empty state now routes individuals to `/app/i/portfolio`.
   - Org entry now routes to `/app/o/[slug]/assignments`.

3. Active tests still referenced non-MVP or archived surfaces.
   - Updated strict a11y from `/app/i/expertise` to `/app/i/portfolio`.
   - Updated individual PRD route contract tests to current proof portfolio, verification, communications, and privacy settings surfaces.
   - Updated CV import hard-gate test so `/app/i/expertise` must remain 404.

4. Several E2E specs encoded post-MVP or legacy product behavior as active launch coverage.
   - Archived Expertise Atlas, org analytics, and legacy broad integration specs under `e2e/archive/`.
   - Added archive READMEs with scope rationale.

5. Active unit/UI tests still treated archived Expertise Atlas and legacy CV wizard components as launch behavior.
   - Moved old Expertise Atlas widget, Add Skill drawer, L4 card, skill-normalization, and CV/JD import wizard UI tests to `tests/archive/non_mvp_expertise_ui/` with `.archived` filenames.
   - Removed the excluded duplicate `tests/api/cv-import-wizard-routes.test.ts` from active test paths; `tests/api/archived-api-handlers-route.test.ts` remains the active 410 proof for those handlers.
   - Updated stale user-facing copy in the profile skill picker from "Expertise Atlas skills" to "proof skills".
   - Updated the GCP CV OCR proposal note so it points to the active archived-handler route test and the archived UI test folder.

6. Active docs still described retired routes as if they were launchable.
   - Updated `README.md` so `/api/expertise/cv-import/wizard-*` is described only as archived 410 compatibility, with active assisted import/proof work routed to Start from CV and Proof Artifact Text Extraction.
   - Rewrote `docs/EXPERTISE_ATLAS_SETUP.md` as retained taxonomy/service context, not an active Expertise Atlas UI setup guide.
   - Updated `docs/ACCESSIBILITY.md` away from the archived Expertise Atlas page and toward Proof Portfolio / Proof Pack workflows.
   - Updated `docs/mobile/IOS_PARITY_MATRIX.md` away from Expertise/Contracts/Projects modules and toward Proof Packs, decisions/feedback, engagement verification, and launch-ops language.

7. Active admin tests still exercised archived broad admin suite behavior.
   - Moved archived admin users, fairness metrics, fairness report, and cron-summary route tests under `src/archive/non_launch_api/app/api/admin/__tests__/` so they run only through the archived test config.
   - Moved stale broad admin organization-table and fairness analytics helper UI/lib tests under `tests/archive/non_mvp_admin_suite/`.
   - Kept the active admin launch corridor focused on `/admin`, `/admin/verification`, and `/admin/audit`.

8. Proof-first onboarding was still marked stale/UNVERIFIED in the verification checklist.
   - Reran the focused onboarding suite covering route selection, first-proof UI, canonical Proof Pack writes, private context scaffolding, and readiness state.
   - Verified `/onboarding` through Browser in mock-auth mode: H1 `Start with one Proof Pack`; first step asks only for name/residence; continuing reveals `Add one proof artifact`, proof link/file choice, ownership, skills, measured outcomes, and scoped verification options.
   - Updated `docs/verification-checklist.md` so the proof-first onboarding row records the fresh 2026-05-19 evidence and status `PASS`.

9. Proof Pack anchor integrity was still marked stale/UNVERIFIED in the verification checklist.
   - Rechecked schema migration `20260313210500_harden_proof_pack_anchor_contract.sql`: it backfills owner anchors for export packs, infers verification-bundle context anchors where possible, quarantines remaining legacy missing-anchor verification bundles, requires non-null primary anchors, and enforces pack-kind-specific anchor constraints.
   - Rechecked runtime enforcement in `src/lib/proofs/pack-anchor.ts` and `src/lib/canonical/repository.ts`: missing, invalid, or mismatched primary anchors are rejected; export packs must anchor to an owner; verification bundles must anchor to work, education, or volunteering context; quarantined packs are not exportable.
   - Reran the focused anchor/export/readiness suite: 11 files / 46 tests passed, including Proof Pack anchor policy, canonical skill proof writes, intro-readiness orphan blocking, owned-anchor API creation, export/public export/text-pack behavior, onboarding actions, and verification-integrity alignment.
   - Updated `docs/verification-checklist.md` so the Proof Pack anchor integrity row records the fresh 2026-05-19 evidence and status `PASS`.

10. Export/delete/auditability was still marked stale/UNVERIFIED in the verification checklist.

- Reran the Phase 1 evidence pack for public summary/export, individual export, organization export, account lifecycle, retired deletion cron routes, user export, and audit-log visibility: 11 files / 55 tests passed.
- Confirmed public portfolio summary/export gating remains distinct from authenticated owner exports.
- Confirmed authenticated portfolio/org exports preserve authorization behavior, including unauthenticated, missing-profile, forbidden reviewer, inactive-member, and success states.
- Confirmed user data export blocks while deletion is processing or in manual-review failure states.
- Confirmed account deletion is immediate and irreversible after password/phrase confirmation, cancel-deletion returns `410`, and scheduled deletion cron routes return archived responses.
- Confirmed auditability coverage for org-owner audit export, admin break-glass org audit reads, the settings audit-log page, and retired individual purpose audit history.
- Updated `docs/verification-checklist.md` so the export/delete/auditability row records the fresh 2026-05-19 evidence and status `PASS`.

11. The no-non-MVP-launch-surface checklist row still carried a stale 2026-03-25 `FAIL`.

- Reran `npm run test:launch:routes`: launch API inventory, launch page inventory, archived API handler, and middleware archive tests all passed.
- Fresh route counts: 139 compiled API handlers and 51 compiled pages.
- Current launch-surface policy explicitly classifies 109 APIs and 48 pages as active launch paths, 16 APIs and 3 pages as internal-only launch ops, and 14 compiled API handlers as archived compatibility responses.
- Required hard-gated pages are absent from the compiled launch surface, and representative archived API/page families remain classified archived at the route-surface policy boundary.
- Updated `docs/verification-checklist.md` so the no-non-MVP-launch-surface row records the fresh 2026-05-19 evidence and status `PASS`.

12. Browser coverage for authenticated individual, organization, and admin/internal surfaces was incomplete.

- Reconnected the Codex in-app Browser and ran the local app in mock individual, mock organization, and mock admin modes.
- Individual Browser pass covered `/app/i/home`, `/app/i/portfolio`, `/app/i/verifications`, `/app/i/communications`, and `/app/i/settings/privacy`.
- Organization Browser pass covered `/app/o/test-org/home`, `/app/o/test-org/assignments`, `/app/o/test-org/assignments/new`, `/app/o/test-org/interviews`, `/app/o/test-org/communications`, `/app/o/test-org/portfolio`, and the intentional `/app/o/test-org/shortlist` shortcut back to assignments.
- Admin Browser pass covered non-admin fail-closed `403` behavior for `/admin`, `/admin/verification`, and `/admin/audit`, then mock-admin rendering for `/admin`, `/admin/verification`, and `/admin/audit`.
- Mobile Browser pass covered `/admin/verification` and `/portfolio/org/test-org` at 390 x 844 with no horizontal overflow or runtime-error text.
- Browser copy sweep found stale privacy-page wording, so `PrivacyOverview` now uses `Proof skills and work evidence` instead of `Skills and expertise`.

13. The remaining interaction E2E risk still needed fresh strict-corridor evidence.

- Reran `npm run test:launch:workflow`: 14 files / 88 tests passed, covering org match review, interview schedule/edit/complete/cancel, decision routes/windows, engagement verification, reveal, workflow contracts, idempotency, email privacy, and reveal timeout.
- Reran `npm run test:launch:org-corridor`: 5 files / 41 tests passed, covering matching review contracts, org match review, hiring corridor snapshots, organization interview actions, and engagement verification smoke.
- Reran Phase 3 focused checks: `tests/api/assignments-publish-route.test.ts`, `tests/lib/launch-assignment-publish-smoke.test.ts`, `tests/api/engagement-verifications-route.test.ts`, `tests/lib/workflow-decision-record.test.ts`, and `tests/lib/authz-policy.test.ts` passed, 5 files / 34 tests.
- Reran Phase 2 focused review/reveal/authz checks: verification status/options, org match review, conversation reveal, engagement verification, authz, and decision-record tests passed, 7 files / 55 tests.
- Ran `npm run test:strict:quality`: strict E2E quality guard passed for 8 files.
- Attempted `npm run test:e2e:org:strict` in the sandbox; the web server could not bind `0.0.0.0:33100` due `EPERM`. Reran with approved escalation and the strict org Playwright suite passed `7/7` in 7.9m.
- Strict E2E emitted a slow `/api/assignments` GET warning at 21633ms and an unknown matrix skill warning for strict resume fixture skills; both are recorded as operational watch noise because the strict suite passed and Phase 3 already tracks assignment publish/perf hardening.
- Updated `docs/verification-checklist.md` so blind review, candidate-consented reveal, assignment create/edit/publish, and the full review-to-engagement corridor rows cite the fresh 2026-05-19 strict/workflow evidence.

14. Docs freshness still carried 44 registry warnings for existing artifact, audit, and migration README files.

- Registered the remaining orphan Markdown files in `docs/DOCS_REGISTRY.md` as reference or historical documentation surfaces, keeping generated source-refresh snapshots historical where appropriate.
- Reran `npm run docs:freshness`; it now passes with no findings.

15. API reference freshness lagged the launch route inventory.

- Updated `scripts/generate-api-reference.mjs` so generated API docs include the launch-surface classification from `src/lib/launch/surface-policy.ts`.
- Fixed method extraction for re-export-only handlers such as `/api/match/assignment`, `/api/match/interest`, and `/api/match/profile`, removing stale `UNKNOWN` method output.
- Regenerated `docs/API_REFERENCE.md`: it now reports 139 route handlers, 109 active MVP APIs, 16 internal launch-ops APIs, and 14 archived compatibility APIs.
- Admin/internal routes now show `Auth Tier` `internal` and `Launch Surface` `internal launch ops` instead of appearing as ordinary public endpoints.
- Archived compatibility routes such as legacy analytics, CV wizard, old deletion crons, `/api/match/test`, `/api/performance/track`, and `/api/profile/completeness` are explicitly marked `archived compatibility`.

## Browser Evidence

Tool: Codex in-app Browser at `http://localhost:33180`.

Continuation check on 2026-05-19:

- Reconnected the Codex in-app Browser after the original local server had stopped.
- Restarted the local dev server normally; `/portfolio/demo` and `/portfolio/demo-proofound` correctly rendered `Public page unavailable` in non-mock mode, with no public leak surface.
- Restarted the local dev server in mock mode after sandboxed port binding failed with `EPERM`; approved escalation allowed `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_SUPABASE=true MOCK_ORG_MODE=true MOCK_ADMIN_MODE=true npm run dev` to bind `localhost:3000`.
- Browser verified `/portfolio/demo-proofound` in mock mode: title `Proofound Public Page`, H1 `Mika Andersson`, primary actions `Copy share link`, `Download trust PDF`, `Copy recruiter summary`, and `Request introduction`; visible copy kept public-safe Proof Pack, direct-link, search-off, and private-details-hidden language.
- Browser verified `/portfolio/org/test-org` in mock mode: title `Proofound organization portfolio`, H1 `Test Organization`, action `Copy share link`, return link `/`, website link `https://test-org.example`, assignment clarity/proof expectations/seriousness-of-review sections, verified domain path, and blind-by-default consent separation.
- Browser verified `/` in mock mode: title `Proofound | Proof Behind the Claim`, H1 `Proof behind the claim`, CTAs route to `/signup`, `/signup/individual`, `/signup/organization`, `/login`, and legal links route to `/cookies`, `/cookies/settings`, `/privacy`, and `/terms`.
- Browser screenshot capture timed out in this runtime, so evidence was gathered through Browser navigation plus DOM/visible-state reads instead of screenshots.

Desktop checks:

- `/portfolio/demo` rendered `Public page unavailable` with no public leak surface observed.
- `/` rendered `Proof behind the claim`.
- `Create your proof portfolio` link count: 1.
- Clicking `Create your proof portfolio` navigated to `/signup/individual`.
- `Request a pilot` anchors point to `/signup/organization`; direct click landed on `/signup/organization`.
- `/signup`, `/signup/organization`, and `/signup/individual` loaded with expected signup headings.
- `/portfolio/demo` was rechecked through the Codex in-app Browser after restarting the local dev server: title `Public Page Unavailable | Proofound`, H1 `Public page unavailable`, Return home link `/`, console warnings/errors `[]`.

Mobile viewport check:

- Viewport: 390 x 844.
- `/` rendered `Proof behind the claim`.
- Mobile header `Sign in` and `Start` were visible.
- `/portfolio/demo` rendered `Public page unavailable`.

Authenticated/mock Browser check:

- Server: `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_SUPABASE=true PLAYWRIGHT=true PORT=33180 npm run dev -- --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 33180`.
- `/onboarding` rendered H1 `Start with one Proof Pack`.
- After filling basic details and continuing, Browser rendered `Add one proof artifact`, `Proof link *`, `Ownership for this proof`, `What was your ownership? *`, `3 to 5 skills this proof supports *`, measured outcomes, scoped verification options, and `Save first Proof Pack`.
- DOM checks: `hasProofLink=true`, `hasProofPack=true`, `hasOwnership=true`, `hasHeadline=false`, `hasPercentComplete=false`, `hasResumeWizard=false`.

Authenticated individual Browser pass:

- Server mode: `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_SUPABASE=true PLAYWRIGHT=true`.
- `/app/i/home` rendered `Add your first proof record`, proof wallet checks, trust-anchor state, and private-by-default public-page visibility.
- `/app/i/portfolio` intentionally redirected into the profile safe-shell proof-pack tab and rendered `Mock Individual`, `Keep building proof readiness`, safe-shell basics, proof readiness, and locked public-page state.
- `/app/i/verifications` rendered `Proof verification requests`, incoming/sent filters, zero-state copy, and bounded request status language without loading or runtime-error text after settling.
- `/app/i/communications` rendered proof-safe communications, messages/interviews tabs, reveal/interview/decision language, and private-before-reveal empty state.
- `/app/i/settings/privacy` rendered privacy controls, export/account-history actions, visibility summary, and data categories without runtime-error text.

Authenticated organization Browser pass:

- Server mode: `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_SUPABASE=true PLAYWRIGHT=true MOCK_ORG_MODE=true`.
- `/app/o/test-org/home` rendered `Test Organization`, launch corridor queue, trust/profile/assignment readiness, and minimal role-access context.
- `/app/o/test-org/assignments` rendered `Assignments`, one-assignment corridor copy, `Create assignment`, and empty-state next actions.
- `/app/o/test-org/assignments/new` rendered the lean assignment builder with purpose, work, proof, constraints, and review/publish steps; the next action is disabled until required role context is supplied.
- `/app/o/test-org/interviews` rendered the empty active-hiring-corridor state with shortlist/interview/decision/engagement verification language.
- `/app/o/test-org/communications` rendered organization messages/interviews tabs, intro/reveal request language, and privacy-safe no-conversations state.
- `/app/o/test-org/portfolio` redirected to `/portfolio/org/test-org?returnTo=...` and rendered public organization trust content with direct-link sharing, proof expectations, verified domain path, and consented reveal separation.
- `/app/o/test-org/shortlist` intentionally redirected to assignments, matching the active route-shortcut contract and hidden standalone shortlist navigation.

Authenticated admin/internal Browser pass:

- Non-admin mock mode: `/admin`, `/admin/verification`, and `/admin/audit` all redirected to `403` with no diagnostic leak.
- Admin mock mode: `/admin` rendered `Launch Operations` with narrow links to operations queues and audit support.
- `/admin/verification` rendered `Operations Queues`, verification/privacy/reveal/risky-upload/pilot queues, and empty verification queue state.
- `/admin/audit` rendered `Audit Logs` with administrative action rows and pagination.
- Mobile viewport 390 x 844: `/admin/verification` and `/portfolio/org/test-org` rendered with `hasHorizontalOverflow=false` and no runtime-error text.

- `npm run test:strict:quality` - passed for 8 strict E2E files.
- `npm run test:e2e:org:strict` - first sandbox run failed before tests because the Playwright web server could not bind `0.0.0.0:33100` (`EPERM`); approved escalated rerun passed, 7/7 in 7.9m.
- `node scripts/generate-api-reference.mjs` - regenerated `docs/API_REFERENCE.md` with 139 endpoints across 31 families and launch-surface classifications.
- `PATH=/Users/yuriibakurov/.nvm/versions/node/v25.4.0/bin:$PATH npm run test:launch:routes` - passed, 4 files / 25 tests, after the default Node runtime failed before tests on `node:fs/promises.constants`.
- `npm run lint` - passed.
- `PATH=/Users/yuriibakurov/.nvm/versions/node/v25.4.0/bin:$PATH npm run typecheck` - passed.
- `npm run docs:freshness` - passed with no findings after registry cleanup.
- `rg` active-test sweep after archiving: active tests no longer import `ExpertiseAtlasClient`, old CV/JD import wizard components, broad Add Skill drawer flows, or archived L4 card/widget tests outside `tests/archive/`.
- `rg` active-test sweep after admin archiving: active tests outside `src/archive` and `tests/archive` no longer import archived admin users/fairness route modules, `OrganizationsTable`, `generateFairnessNoteResult`, or the retired `calculateFairnessGaps` broad admin helper.
- Current-doc stale route sweep no longer finds active non-archive assertions that `/app/i/expertise`, `/app/i/projects`, legacy CV wizard routes, contracts/projects modules, or Expertise Atlas UI are launch surfaces in the patched README, retained setup, accessibility, mobile parity, and QA summary docs.

Non-fatal test noise:

- Vitest/Vite reported `listen EPERM` for WebSocket port `24678` in the sandbox, but tests completed and passed.
- Node emitted existing `--localstorage-file` warnings during Vitest runs.
- Default-runtime `npm run test:launch:routes` failed before tests because the local Node version did not expose `node:fs/promises.constants` for the current Vite package. The same route inventory command passed under the repo-required Node 25 runtime.
- Archived `notFound()` page tests log jsdom React error output while asserting the 404 boundary; the archived tests passed.
- Strict org E2E emitted a slow `/api/assignments` GET warning at 21633ms and `assignment.create.unknown_matrix_skills` for strict resume fixture skills. The suite still passed; assignment runtime performance remains a Phase 3 watch item.

## Remaining Risks / Unverified

- This pass fixed and verified a high-signal launch slice, not every authenticated data state in the product.
- Authenticated Browser coverage now includes representative individual, organization, admin/internal, public org, 403, and mobile surfaces. Full strict Playwright evidence now covers the interactive org corridor, but Browser itself did not click through every modal/control in proof upload, reveal consent, interview scheduling/reschedule, decision recording, or engagement verification.
- Production deployment, live auth, billing, infra, and permission behavior were not changed or smoke-tested.
- No current docs freshness warnings remain after registering the existing orphan documentation/artifact files.
