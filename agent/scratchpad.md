Task summary:
Create `agent/scratchpad.md` and establish the per-session logging convention.

What worked:

- Repo exploration to confirm existing docs and folder layout.

What failed / wrong assumptions:

- None.

User corrections:

- None.

Improvements next time:

- Add the entry at the actual end of the session after implementation work is complete.

Commands run + outcomes:

- `ls -la`: inspected repo root.
- `find . -maxdepth 3 -type f (...)`: located existing `project/` and `agent/` docs.
- `sed -n '1,200p' project/*.md agent/**/*.md`: reviewed current conventions.
- `git status --porcelain`: clean.

Open TODOs / follow-ups:

- None.

Task summary:
Make the Zoom meetings OAuth flow production-safe for `proofound.io` by aligning the base URL env var usage, fixing docs drift, and verifying Vercel project/env configuration.

What worked:

- Updating OAuth routes to prefer `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` reduced reliance on a niche `NEXT_PUBLIC_URL` variable.
- Re-linking the local Vercel config to the correct project (`proofound-platform`) enabled pulling the correct production env vars.
- Local and Vercel parity builds passed under Node `20.20.0`.

What failed / wrong assumptions:

- Initially ran `vercel build --prod` without forcing Node `20.20.0` in `PATH`, which caused it to execute under an older Node version locally and fail.

User corrections:

- Production domain is `proofound.io`.
- Zoom credentials are defined in Vercel.

Improvements next time:

- Always prefix Vercel CLI parity commands with the same Node version used for repo verification.
- Avoid running commands that depend on `.vercel/project.json` concurrently, as it can create misleading intermediate output.

Commands run + outcomes:

- `PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/node@20/bin:$PATH npm run lint`: PASS
- `PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/node@20/bin:$PATH npm run typecheck`: PASS
- `PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/node@20/bin:$PATH npm run test`: PASS
- `PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/node@20/bin:$PATH npm run build`: PASS
- `npx vercel@latest link --project proofound-platform --yes --token $VERCEL_TOKEN`: PASS
- `npx vercel@latest pull --yes --environment=production --token $VERCEL_TOKEN`: PASS
- `npx vercel@latest env add NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL production --yes --force --token $VERCEL_TOKEN`: PASS
- `npx vercel@latest env add ZOOM_REDIRECT_URI production --yes --force --token $VERCEL_TOKEN`: PASS
- `PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/node@20/bin:$PATH npx vercel@latest build --prod --token $VERCEL_TOKEN`: PASS

Open TODOs / follow-ups:

- Ensure the Zoom Marketplace OAuth Redirect URL is exactly `https://proofound.io/api/integrations/zoom/callback`.

## 2026-02-07 09:50 CET

Task summary:
Add `agent/scratchpad.md`, document the convention in `project/Documentation.md`, and commit the docs changes.

What worked:

- Used repo docs (`project/*.md`, `agent/*`) to align formatting and conventions.
- Kept the change docs-only and scoped to the required files.

What failed / wrong assumptions:

- Initially drafted nested bullets in `project/Documentation.md`; adjusted to flat bullets to match repo formatting rules.

User corrections:

- None.

Improvements next time:

- Incorporate "why/how to verify/open risks" into `project/Documentation.md` in the first commit to avoid a follow-up commit.

Commands run + outcomes:

- `date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M %Z"`: captured timestamps (2026-02-07 09:49 CET, 2026-02-07 09:50 CET).
- `git status --porcelain`: verified clean worktree before and after commits.
- `git add agent/scratchpad.md project/Documentation.md`: staged intended docs only.
- `git commit -m "docs: add agent session scratchpad"`: PASS.
- `git add project/Documentation.md`: staged follow-up doc-only tweak.
- `git commit -m "docs: document scratchpad convention"`: PASS.
- `git show -1 --name-only --stat`: verified commit contents.

Open TODOs / follow-ups:

- None.

## 2026-02-11 09:08 CET

Task summary:

- Finalize isolated LinkedIn OAuth hotfix branch and prepare clean deployment path.

What worked:

- Resolved docs merge conflicts by keeping isolated branch base content and appending a fresh session entry.
- Kept commit scope focused on LinkedIn OAuth redirect and verification UX behavior.

What failed / wrong assumptions:

- Branch context switched unexpectedly during execution, which moved docs edits to a different branch and required stash-transfer recovery.

User corrections:

- User selected option `2` to keep `FairnessNoteCard` as-is while continuing.

Assumptions taken without asking:

- Unrelated modified files can stay uncommitted while LinkedIn-scope files are committed and pushed.

What the user corrected afterward:

- None.

Improvements next time:

- Before cross-branch stash apply, assert branch + status in a single guarded command and abort if unexpected modified files exist.

Commands run + outcomes:

- `git stash push -m "move-doc-updates-to-isolated-linkedin-hotfix" project/Documentation.md agent/scratchpad.md`: PASS
- `git stash push -u -m "wip: park unrelated local changes before isolated linkedin hotfix finish"`: PASS
- `git checkout codex/linkedin-oauth-hotfix-isolated`: PASS
- `git stash apply stash@{1}`: CONFLICT in docs files
- `git checkout --ours project/Documentation.md agent/scratchpad.md`: PASS
- `git add project/Documentation.md agent/scratchpad.md`: PASS

Open TODOs / follow-ups:

- Run final verification on isolated branch and push.
- Confirm Vercel deployment reaches READY and perform manual OAuth smoke on allowlisted domain.
