# üìä Database Integration Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### 1. Schema Verification

- **Status**: ‚úÖ Complete
- All 27 migrations applied successfully
- All required tables verified:
  - Core: `profiles`, `organizations`, `organization_members`
  - Extensions: `individual_profiles`, `impact_stories`, `experiences`, `education`, `volunteering`
  - Matching: `matching_profiles`, `assignments`, `matches`, `match_interest`, `skills`
  - Supporting: `audit_logs`, `feature_flags`, `rate_limits`, `org_invitations`
- Foreign key relationships properly configured
- RLS enabled on all public tables

### 2. Critical Bug Fixes

#### Organization Onboarding RLS Issue

- **Problem**: Chicken-and-egg problem during org creation. Organizations SELECT policy required existing membership, causing insert failures.
- **Solution**:
  1. Applied migration `fix_organization_rls_for_onboarding` to allow creators immediate SELECT access
  2. Updated `completeOrganizationOnboarding()` to handle RLS read-back errors gracefully
  3. Fixed 1 orphaned organization by adding missing membership
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed and tested

#### Data Integrity

- Fixed orphaned organization "pavlik" (0 members) by adding owner membership
- All organizations now have proper owner memberships
- Verified data consistency across profiles and organizations

### 3. API Endpoints Reviewed

#### `/api/matching-profile` ‚úÖ

- Proper GET and PUT handlers
- Zod validation for all inputs
- Upsert logic handles create and update
- Skills managed separately with delete/insert pattern
- Proper error handling and logging

#### `/api/assignments` ‚úÖ

- GET returns all assignments for user's org
- POST creates new assignment with validation
- Proper org membership checks
- Returns appropriate errors (403 for non-members)

#### `/api/updates` ‚úÖ

- Implemented with proper auth
- Returns empty array currently (as intended for MVP)
- Structured for future implementation of activity feed
- Handles errors gracefully

### 4. Server Actions Reviewed

#### Authentication (`/src/actions/auth.ts`) ‚úÖ

- Rate limiting implemented
- Proper email normalization
- Persona stored in user metadata
- Error handling for duplicate accounts
- Revalidation after auth changes

#### Onboarding (`/src/actions/onboarding.ts`) ‚úÖ

- `completeIndividualOnboarding()`: Updates profiles + creates individual_profiles
- `completeOrganizationOnboarding()`: Creates org + membership + updates persona
- **Fixed**: Now handles RLS read-back errors correctly
- Proper validation for handles and slugs
- Returns clear error messages

#### Profile (`/src/actions/profile.ts`) ‚úÖ

- Full CRUD for impact stories, experiences, education, volunteering
- Updates for basic info, mission, values, causes, skills
- Auto-creates individual_profiles if missing
- Proper auth checks via `requireAuth()`
- Revalidation after mutations

### 5. RLS Policies

#### Organizations

```sql
-- INSERT: Creators can create orgs
-- SELECT: Members + Creators can view (FIXED!)
-- UPDATE: Owners/Admins can update
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed

#### Organization Members

```sql
-- INSERT: Users can insert own owner membership
-- SELECT: Users can view own memberships
-- UPDATE: Users can update own membership
-- DELETE: Users can delete own membership
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ Working correctly

#### Individual Profiles

```sql
-- INSERT: Users can insert own profile
-- SELECT: Public profiles or own profile
-- UPDATE: Users can update own profile
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ Working correctly

### 6. Data Validation

#### Zod Schemas ‚úÖ

- All API routes use Zod validation
- Clear error messages for invalid input
- Type-safe throughout

#### Business Logic Validation ‚úÖ

- Unique constraint checks (email, handle, slug)
- Format validation (handle regex, slug regex)
- Enum validation (persona, work_mode, etc.)
- Permission checks before mutations

## üîÑ Remaining Work

### Manual Testing Required

The code is solid, but requires **manual browser testing** to verify end-to-end flows:

1. **Individual Onboarding Flow** - Test complete signup ‚Üí onboarding ‚Üí dashboard flow
2. **Organization Onboarding Flow** - Test org creation, membership, dashboard access
3. **Profile Editing** - Test all CRUD operations persist correctly
4. **Matching Setup** - Test matching profile creation and match viewing
5. **Assignment Creation** - Test assignment CRUD for organizations
6. **Authentication** - Test login, logout, password reset, social auth
7. **Settings** - Test settings pages load and save correctly
8. **Permissions** - Test RLS prevents unauthorized access

Refer to `/MANUAL_TESTING_GUIDE.md` for detailed testing instructions.

### Future Enhancements

#### Dashboard Activity Feed

- Implement real queries in `/api/updates`
- Aggregate matches, profile views, applications
- Display in WhileAwayCard

#### Profile Features

- Avatar upload integration
- Cover image upload integration
- Profile completion percentage calculation
- Public profile viewing

#### Matching Features

- Match algorithm integration (already has basic structure)
- Match favoriting
- Match notifications
- Filters and weights UI

#### Organization Features

- Member invitations (table exists, need UI)
- Role management UI
- Team activity dashboard
- Organization metrics

## üí° Key Learnings

### RLS Best Practices:

- Avoid chicken-and-egg problems by allowing creators immediate SELECT access
- Don't rely on INSERT returning data if RLS might block SELECT
- Handle RLS errors gracefully in onboarding flows
- Use service role sparingly, prefer proper RLS policies

### Onboarding Flow Design:

- Create parent records before child records
- Set up permissions before requiring access
- Handle edge cases (existing users, duplicate data)
- Provide clear error messages

### Error Handling:

- Distinguish between validation errors and system errors
- Log errors server-side, show user-friendly messages client-side
- Use Zod for input validation
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes
