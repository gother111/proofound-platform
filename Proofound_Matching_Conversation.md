User:
I would like you to help me out with documenting the matching algorithms.
Matching would be happening accordign to skill match, mission/vision/values/causes alignment; then practical stuff like availability, location, salary, etc.
So there will be a codified database of different skills. It would follow this logic - six major categories, then subcategories, and then skills. The code IDs would have three parts corresponding to a specific skill. 
I would like you to recall everything we spoke abuut in this regard and come up with the matching algprithm instruction for backend and different strategies how this could work in practice

Assistant:
Got it. Here’s a tight, implementation-ready spec you can hand to backend + data folks and iterate on with product. I’ve baked in what we discussed earlier: a region-agnostic 6→subcats→skills tree with 3-part codes; matching on skills + mission/vision/values/causes; then “practical fit” (availability, location, salary, etc.); plus transparency, fairness, and learning loops.

# Matching: system overview
**Entities**
- **Individual profile**: skills (with level + recency), work preferences, availability, location/time-zone, comp expectations, mission/values/causes.
- **Organization/Assignment**: required & nice-to-have skills (with level), mission/values/causes, role details (availability window, location policy, contract type, budget).
- **Taxonomies**:  
  - **Skill Tree** (6 major categories → subcategories → skills), 3-part codes.  
  - **Values/Causes** taxonomy (flat or hierarchical).  
  - **Mission/Vision** free-text.

**Pipelines (high-level)**
1) **Candidate/Opportunity ingestion → normalization → embeddings + graph features**  
2) **Two-stage retrieval**: fast semantic retrieval (ANN over embeddings) → precise re-rank with multi-objective scoring.  
3) **Explain + feedback**: human-readable “why” + capture accept/skip/adjust.  
4) **Online learning**: pairwise LTR on feedback; weight calibration by segment.

# Data model (core tables/columns)

**skills_categories**  
- `cat_id` (int, 1–6), `slug`, `name_i18n`, `version`

**skills_subcategories**  
- `cat_id`, `subcat_id` (int), `slug`, `name_i18n`, `version`

**skills**  
- `cat_id`, `subcat_id`, `skill_id` (int), `code` (e.g., `02.07.142`), `slug`, `name_i18n`, `aliases_i18n[]`, `description_i18n`, `relations` (graph edges: `is_a`, `related_to`, `adjacent_to`), `status` (active/deprecated), `version`, `embedding` (vector)

**profiles_individual**  
- `user_id`, `location_geo`, `time_zone`, `availability_calendar/ref`, `comp_currency`, `comp_min`, `comp_target`, `mission_text`, `values_tags[]`, `causes_tags[]`, `mission_embedding` (vector)

**profiles_individual_skills**  
- `user_id`, `code`, `level` (0–5), `evidence_refs[]`, `last_used_at`, `confidence` (0–1)

**profiles_org**  
- `org_id`, `mission_text`, `values_tags[]`, `causes_tags[]`, `mission_embedding`

**roles** (assignments/projects/jobs)  
- `role_id`, `org_id`, `location_policy` (onsite/hybrid/remote), `location_geo`, `time_window` (UTC ranges), `contract_type`, `budget_min/max`, `required_skills[{code, level, weight}]`, `nice_skills[{code, level, weight}]`, `mission_text`, `values_tags[]`, `causes_tags[]`, `mission_embedding`, `language_requirements[]`

**signals_feedback**  
- `subject_id` (role or profile), `object_id` (profile or role), `event` (view/expand/click/contact/accept/reject), `reason_tags[]`, `weights_snapshot`, `timestamp`

> Notes  
> • Keep multilingual: names/aliases/desc per locale; embeddings in a multilingual model.  
> • Store embeddings in `pgvector` (Supabase/Postgres) or a vector service (Pinecone); graph edges in a simple table or Neo4j if you prefer rich traversal.  
> • Version skills; never delete—deprecate and map forward.

---

# Skill codes (3-part)
`{CAT}.{SUBCAT}.{SKILL}` → all zero-padded numeric strings. Examples:
- `01.03.027`  (Cat 01, Subcat 03, Skill 027)  
- Include human slug mirror: `C01-S03-K027` for UX/debug.  
- Add `version` and an optional `alias_of` for migrations.

# Scoring model (re-ranker)

## Total score
```
Total = w_skill * SkillScore
      + w_mvv  * MissionValuesScore
      + w_prac * PracticalFitScore
```
Default weights (tunable): `w_skill=0.55, w_mvv=0.25, w_prac=0.20`.

## 1) SkillScore (coverage, proximity, level fit, recency)
Let role require set R, candidate set C.

- **Exact coverage** (required): weighted Jaccard on required skills with level gating  
  ```
  Coverage_req = Σ_i (req_i.weight * match_i) / Σ_i req_i.weight
  where match_i = min( level_c / level_req , 1 ) if skill exact or adjacent; else 0
  ```
- **Adjacency bonus**: if no exact, allow graph-adjacent skill within distance d (1–2 hops) with decay `adj_decay = exp(-λ * distance)`; examples: `Kubernetes` ↔ `Container Orchestration`.  
- **Nice-to-have**: same calc on N, lower weight cap.

- **Recency** time-decay on each skill: `recency = exp( -α * months_since_used )`.

- **Proficiency shape**: reward meeting or slightly exceeding required level; softly penalize overshoot/undershoot to avoid inflating generalists.

Final (example):
```
SkillScore = 0.7*Coverage_req + 0.3*Coverage_nice
             all multiplied by mean(recency) and adjacency factors per match
```

## 2) MissionValuesScore (MVV & causes)
- **Mission/Vision semantic**: cosine similarity between individual mission_embedding and org/role mission_embedding (0–1).
- **Values/Causes tag match**: weighted overlap (role tags vs person tags), with synonym expansion; union with hierarchical ancestors if you model hierarchy.  
- Combine:
```
MissionValuesScore = 0.6 * cos(mission_vec_ind, mission_vec_role)
                   + 0.4 * TagMatch(values ∪ causes)
```
(Shared identity/purpose is predictive for durable cooperation; this maps closely to CDP-1 and related cooperative design principles.) fileciteturn0file2

## 3) PracticalFitScore
Each is a soft constraint contributing penalties; “hard” constraints can short-circuit if policy requires.

- **Availability overlap**: fraction overlap between candidate availability blocks and role’s required windows/time zone tolerance (0–1).  
- **Location**:  
  - Policy = remote/hybrid/onsite;  
  - Distance penalty for onsite/hybrid: `pen_dist = min(1, (km / radius_km))` with decay; visa/work authorization if modeled.  
- **Compensation**: penalty if `comp_min > budget_max`; small penalty if `comp_target` above `budget_mid`.  
- **Language**: requirement unmet → strong penalty or hard fail.

Aggregate with bounded penalties so one factor can’t zero out a match unless marked “hard”.

### BiasControls (fairness regularizers)
- **Feature clipping**: cap any single component contribution (e.g., ≤ 0.6 of Total).  
- **Group-level exploration**: stochastic tie-breakers to surface near-ties from under-exposed segments (no protected attributes needed; use uncertainty & representation rates).  
- **Calibration per role family**: keep weights consistent across cohorts; monitor disparate selection rates without using sensitive attributes directly.

# Retrieval → Re-rank flow

1) **Candidate/role encoders**
   - **Skills vector**: sparse binary/weighted vector over skill codes; plus a dense embedding from skill text + aliases.  
   - **Mission embedding**: sentence embedding of mission/vision text.  
   - **Values/causes**: average of tag embeddings.

2) **ANN retrieval (stage-1)**  
   - **Query vector =** concat/average of role’s required skill embeddings + mission embedding.  
   - Retrieve Top-K (e.g., 500) candidates via cosine in vector index.

3) **Stage-2 re-rank**  
   - Compute `Total` with full features (coverage, adjacency via graph, recency, comp/location/availability, MVV, etc.).  
   - Return top N (e.g., 20) with **explanations**.

---

# Explanations (transparency)
Return top drivers (+/-), e.g.:
- “Matched 7/9 required skills at level ≥ 3 (Kubernetes 4, Postgres 4)…”
- “Mission similarity 0.83; shared causes: ‘climate resilience’, ‘open education’…”
- “Time-zone overlap 100%; comp target within range; hybrid commute 14 km.”

This increases trust and supports fair decision-making (monitoring agreed behaviors & fair decision making echo known cooperation principles). fileciteturn0file2

# Practical strategies (how to roll it out)

**Strategy A — Rules-first minimal viable matching**
- Hard-filter on *must* (non-negotiable skills, language, legal work status).  
- Deterministic scoring for skills + availability; simple tag overlap for values/causes.  
- Pros: fast, explainable; Cons: lower recall, brittle synonyms.

**Strategy B — Semantic hybrid (recommended)**
- ANN retrieval over embeddings (skills + mission) → multi-objective re-rank as above.  
- Graph adjacency for near-skills; soft penalties for practicals.  
- Pros: robust to synonyms, explainable re-rank; Cons: requires embeddings infra.

**Strategy C — Multi-objective optimizer**
- Treat as Pareto ranking on (Skills, MVV, Practical).  
- Surface diverse frontier candidates (some “values-max”, some “skills-max”) to let humans choose; good for *Expertise Atlas* use-cases.

**Strategy D — Learning-to-rank (phase 2)**
- Train pairwise LTR (e.g., XGBoost/LambdaMART) on accept/reject & outcome signals; keep rule layer as guardrails.  
- Use **counterfactual logging** to avoid feedback loops; enforce caps to avoid overfitting to popular skills.

**Strategy E — Group/team matching**
- Extend objective with team diversity/coverage: maximize union skill coverage & mission alignment across a *set* of people; solve via greedy + swap or ILP for small N.

**Scheduling variant**
- If role is shift-based, integrate a constraint solver (CP-SAT) for availability once match shortlist is chosen.

---

# Cold-start & data quality
- **Skill extraction**: parse CV/LinkedIn/text; map to codes via semantic search; ask user confirm levels; attach evidence (projects, repos, certs).  
- **Gap inference**: infer adjacent skills via graph; propose learning paths.  
- **Default priors**: if no mission text, derive from values/causes tags; else from org profile.  
- **Versioning**: keep code alias map; telemetry on deprecated → new mapping.

---

# Metrics & monitoring
- **Quality**: Acceptance@K, Contact-through-rate, Time-to-fill, Retention @ 30/90 days.  
- **Fairness**: disparity of exposure/selection across non-sensitive proxies (region, seniority bands, first-seen vs later, etc.); monitor calibration drift.  
- **Explainability**: % matches with clear top-3 drivers; user satisfaction on explanation helpfulness.  
- **System**: ANN latency P95, re-rank CPU time, index freshness SLA.

# Weight governance & cooperation guardrails
Bake in process that mirrors proven cooperation design principles to improve outcomes over time (shared purpose; fair/inclusive decision-making; monitoring; fast/ fair conflict resolution). Use them to:
- Co-create weight templates with stakeholders (engineering, talent, org reps).  
- Publicly document which factors are **hard gates** vs **soft penalties**.  
- Keep an appeals/override log with reasons (feeds the conflict-resolution loop).  
- Monitor for “gaming” and adjust graduated sanctions (e.g., down-weight low-trust evidence). fileciteturn0file2

---

# Implementation notes (stack-friendly)
- **Store**: Postgres (Supabase) + `pgvector` for embeddings; Drizzle ORM schemas as above.  
- **Index**: HNSW (pgvector or external ANN) for mission/skill embeddings.  
- **Graph**: adjacency in SQL (edge table) or Neo4j if you want richer traversal now.  
- **Jobs**: nightly re-index; on-write incremental updates.  
- **I18n**: store aliases per language; multilingual embedding model for semantic parity.

---

## Appendix: calculational details

**Availability overlap**  
Represent availability as weekly bitmaps (7×24 or 7×48).  
`overlap = intersect(bits_person, bits_role) / bits_role_required`.

**Distance**  
`km = haversine(person_geo, role_geo)`.  
Penalty example: `loc = 1 - min(1, km / 30)` for a 30km “ideal” radius (tune by policy).

**Compensation**  
If `comp_min > budget_max` → hard fail (if configured). Else  
`comp = sigmoid( (budget_mid - comp_target) / budget_mid )`.

**Mission similarity**  
`cos = (a·b)/(|a||b|)` using multilingual sentence embeddings.

---

If you want, I can turn this into:
- a concise **matching.md** for your repo,
- Drizzle table definitions,
- and a **weights.json** + **policy.yaml** template (hard vs soft constraints).

And when you want to emphasise durable, prosocial matches in your narrative, you can explicitly connect the MVV alignment and fair decision/monitoring to established cooperation design principles (shared identity/purpose; fair & inclusive decision-making; monitoring & graduated sanctions; fast/fair conflict resolution). That framing is well supported in the literature and helps justify product choices around alignment scoring and transparency. fileciteturn0file2

User:
Let's continue. 
So here is some context for you.
Every human would have their expertise atlases. This is sort of a skill tree with skills taxonomy represented this way:
L1 - six largest skill domains
L2 - large categories within these domains
L3 - subcategories for each large category
L4 - Granular skills/tools/frameworks/concepts/methids/etc. 

The amount of L4 items would be over 10000.

They would be universally codified and each L4 item ID would include L1+L2+L3 indices + L4 unique code.

Each L4 item would have the following attributes:
- Expertise level - C1 to C5 (competency)
- Proof artifacts - links, docs, etc. (uploadable docs up to 5 mb) (n.b. the same artifact can be tied to different L4 items simutaneously) (proof artifacts would live in users' profiles as parts of their work/learning/volunteering/business/hobby experiences; as well as in a separate "My projects" tab)
- Verifications (peer reviews, employer verified, public acknowledgments, etc)
- Recency. Since every L4 is tied to a project that is either Ongoing or Concluded, if we see that this particular skill isn't being used currently we calculate when was it last used.
- As a part of L4 items being tied to a project, consequentially it will be tied to a measurable outcomes figures


So for now save this context, it will be a crucial part of the matching engine

Assistant:
Saved. I’ve added your taxonomy + L4 attributes to our persistent context for the matching engine.

Quick integration notes so backend can act immediately:

- **Taxonomy & IDs**
  - L1→L4 tree with **>10k L4s**; each L4’s **universal code = L1+L2+L3 indices + L4 unique code** (zero-padded), versioned and never deleted (deprecate + map).
- **Competency (C1–C5)**
  - Map to numeric 1–5 for scoring; store both the label (C1…C5) and numeric.
- **Proof artifacts**
  - Separate `artifacts` table (≤5 MB/file) + **many-to-many** link to L4s; artifacts also appear under experiences and “My projects.” De-dup by content hash.
- **Verifications**
  - `verifications` with type (peer/employer/public), issuer, date, and weight; roll-up to an **EvidenceStrength** factor per L4.
- **Recency**
  - Each L4 links to a **project (Ongoing/Concluded)** → compute `last_used_at`; apply time-decay in SkillScore (ongoing = max recency).
- **Measurable outcomes**
  - Store normalized outcome metrics per project; expose an **ImpactScore** feature for that L4 (domain-specific normalization).

If you want, I can next deliver:
- a compact `matching.md` and schema deltas for Drizzle/Supabase, plus
- the scoring inserts that use **Competency × EvidenceStrength × Recency × ImpactScore** inside the SkillScore block.

User:
Next we will talk about a different metric for matching criteria: mission and value alighnment.
Organizations would have their mission+vision+values+causes+impact areas+industry etc. on their profiles permanently. Individual profiles are going to have the same core of mission+values+vision+causes+desired impact created. This domain has to be a part of the matching score.

- Values - no free text, predetermined codified list, searchable through correspondant UI element
- Causes - same
- Mission - freetext, will be matched through keywords at the beginning. Later - AI assisted 
- Vision - same

Industries for companies and NGOs - predetermined, codified list with L1 domains and L2 specializations

Save this context 

Assistant:
Saved. Your mission–values matching domain is now part of our persistent context:

- **Profiles (orgs & individuals)**:  
  - **Values**: predetermined, codified list (no free text).  
  - **Causes**: predetermined, codified list.  
  - **Mission**: free text (v1 keyword match; later AI-assisted embeddings).  
  - **Vision**: free text (same pipeline as mission).  
- **Organizations/NGOs** also include **Industries** from a codified taxonomy (L1 domain → L2 specialization).

If helpful next, I can draft:
- a compact schema patch (tables + enums for values/causes/industries), and
- the MVV scoring block (weights + exact/tag overlap + keyword similarity) to drop into the re-ranker.

User:
Then the matching will also include more practical parameters, like remuneration, availability, work setting, locations/remote, ability/wish for visa sponsorships, specific insurances in form of employment benefits, stock options, car, etc. So make a brief noting on this and we'll move forward

Assistant:
Noted. Here’s a compact, implementation-ready brief for the **Practical Fit** slice of the matching score.

# Practical Fit (v1)

**Signals to store**
- **Compensation**: `currency`, `budget_min/max` (role), `comp_min/target` (person), normalization FX at match time.
- **Availability**: weekly blocks (7×48 bitmap) + **earliest start date**.
- **Work setting**: `onsite | hybrid | remote`; onsite/hybrid include `role_geo`, `ideal_radius_km`.
- **Location/Time-zone**: person `geo`, `tz`; willingness to **relocate** and max distance; **TZ overlap** %.
- **Language**: required vs person’s proficiency.
- **Work authorization & visa**: person legal status; org **sponsorship ability**; person **sponsorship wish/need**.
- **Benefits**: typed matrix (booleans/levels): **insurances** (e.g., health, dental, life, travel), **stock options/equity**, **company car/transport**, pension, wellness, etc.

**Policy**
- **Hard gates (configurable)**: language must-have, legal work eligibility (if sponsorship=false and need=true), mandatory onsite radius (if strict).
- **Soft penalties**: comp mismatch within tolerance, partial TZ overlap, distance beyond ideal but acceptable, missing non-mandatory benefits.

**Scoring (sketch)**
```
PracticalFitScore =
  w_comp   * f_comp(role_budget, person_comp)
+ w_avail  * overlap(availability_bits, required_bits)
+ w_tz     * tz_overlap(tz_role, tz_person)
+ w_loc    * g_distance(role_geo, person_geo, policy)
+ w_lang   * lang_meet(role_langs, person_langs)        // 1 or hard-fail
+ w_auth   * auth_match(sponsorship_ability, need)
+ w_benef  * benefit_match(role_benefits, person_prefs)
```
- Use bounded, monotonic functions; clamp each term to [0,1].
- Currency normalize on the fly; prefer `budget_mid` vs `comp_target` for a smooth sigmoid.
- Distance uses decay; hybrid/onsite only.
- Benefits default to low weight; can be raised for benefit-sensitive roles.

**Explanations**
- “Comp within range (target 55k vs budget 50–60k); 100% availability overlap; hybrid commute 14 km; sponsorship available & requested; matches health+dental; lacks stock options.”

Ready to plug into the overall score as `w_prac * PracticalFitScore`, with hard-gate short-circuit where configured.

User:
Then the flow for assignment creationg would be the following:
1. Expected business value (e.g. increased sales outreach; tightened data security; etc.)
2. Expected outcomes (continuous/milestone): ISO 27001 certification; 10000 new sales leads; new product launched within deadline, - the possibilities are limitless
3. Expertise matrix. Here different people inside the organisation would contribute step by step. Let's take a backend engineer role for example. and assignment creation would go through an HR person who puts in cultural criteria, then a Tech Lead who put in technical and other kinds of skill requirements, and then CEO for additional things. This pipeline would be fully customizable depending on the company's needs.
4. All L4 specs for assignment would be linked to the outcomes to have a better picture of what is expected from a candidate
5. Practical moments - those that we discussed earlier.

And then an assignments is created. And also, a company can make certain sensitive info that is important for assignment not visible even to matched candidates as first. This info would be used in the background and not necessarily exposed - for mutual respect purposes

Note this for youself

Assistant:
Saved. I’ve added the **assignment creation flow** to our persistent context:

1) **Expected business value**  
2) **Expected outcomes** (continuous or milestone)  
3) **Expertise matrix** via a customizable, multi-stakeholder pipeline (e.g., HR → culture, Tech Lead → skills, CEO → strategic add-ons)  
4) **L4 specs linked to outcomes** for traceable expectations  
5) **Practical parameters** (comp, availability, location/remote, sponsorship, benefits)

Also captured: **sensitive fields** usable in matching but hidden from candidates initially, controlled by visibility flags and role-based access + audit.

If you want, I can sketch the DB tables & a small state machine for this pipeline (draft/awaiting-HR/awaiting-TechLead/awaiting-CEO/published) to drop into Drizzle.

User:
So now, when user set up their matching profile and criteria and filled their expertise atlas and filled their mission/vision/....; and on the other end when a company created an assignment with all the fields then can matching engine start working. 
Your task now would be to design the logic of this engine knowing all the necessary context and what would be the most effective way to program/code it. 

Assistant:
Awesome—time to turn all that context into a concrete, buildable **matching engine**. Below is an implementation-ready design tailored to your stack (Next.js/TS, Supabase/Postgres + pgvector, Drizzle). It covers data prep, retrieval, re-rank, explainability, privacy flags, and ops.

# 1) What the engine consumes
- **Candidate profile**: Expertise Atlas (L1→L4 codes), per-L4 attributes (C1–C5, Proof artifacts, Verifications, Recency via Project linkage, Impact/outcomes), MVV (mission/vision free text; values/causes tags), practicals (comp, availability, geo/tz, language, work auth/sponsorship wish, benefits).
- **Assignment**: Expected business value, Expected outcomes (continuous/milestones), Expertise matrix (required/nice L4s with min C-level + weights), MVV (mission/vision text; values/causes; industry L1/L2), practicals (budget, work setting, geo/tz, language, auth/sponsorship ability, benefits), **sensitive fields** with visibility flags.

# 2) High-level architecture
- **Feature builders (workers)**
  - `skills_feature_builder`: converts user L4s → sparse skill map + per-L4 multipliers (Competency/Evidence/Recency/Impact).
  - `text_embedder`: mission/vision to embeddings; values/causes/industry to tag vectors.
  - `role_query_builder`: builds a dense query vector from role requirements (skills + mission/vision + tags).
- **Indexes**
  - `pgvector` HNSW (or external ANN) for candidate vectors.
  - SQL tables for sparse skills + graph edges for adjacency.
- **Matcher service (Fastify/Node or Next.js route)**
  - Stage-1 ANN retrieval → Stage-2 re-rank → explanations → redaction per visibility flags.
- **Feedback logger**
  - Accept/skip/contact/reject events; snapshots of weights; fuels learning-to-rank later.
- **Policy + weights registry**
  - YAML/JSON with weights, hard gates, decay constants—scoped per org if needed.

# 3) Data prep & representations

## 3.1 Skill features per L4 (precompute)
For each candidate L4 code:
```
level ∈ {1..5}  // map C1..C5 → 1..5
evidence_strength ∈ [0,1] 
  = clamp( w_peer*n_peer + w_employer*n_employer + w_public*n_public , 0, 1 )
recency_multiplier ∈ (0,1]
  = exp( -α * months_since_last_used ) ; ongoing ⇒ months=0
impact_score ∈ [0,1]
  = normalize(domain_specific_outcomes)  // e.g., min-max or logistic per metric family
skill_weight = level_factor * evidence_strength * recency_multiplier * (0.5 + 0.5*impact_score)
```
Where `level_factor = min(level / required_level, 1)` during scoring; stored raw level for reuse.

## 3.2 Skill taxonomy graph (adjacency)
Distances:
- dist=0: same L4
- dist=1: same L3, different L4
- dist=2: same L2, different L3
- dist=3: same L1, different L2
Adjacency factor: `adj = exp(-λ * dist)` (e.g., λ=0.7). Cap at dist≤3.

## 3.3 Embeddings & tag vectors
- `mission_vec`, `vision_vec`: multilingual sentence embeddings.
- `values_vec`, `causes_vec`: average of tag embeddings; also store raw tag IDs for exact/synonym overlap.
- Optional: `industry_vec` from L1/L2 industry text.

# 4) Retrieval → Re-rank pipeline

## Stage-0: Hard gates (cheap prefilter)
Configurable; typical:
- Required language(s) unmet → reject.
- Legal work eligibility: if candidate needs sponsorship and org can’t sponsor → reject.
- Budget floor (optional policy): if `candidate.comp_min > role.budget_max` → reject.

## Stage-1: Fast semantic retrieval (ANN)
Build role query vector:
```
role_skill_vec = average( embed(skill_name_i) weighted by req_skill.weight )
mission_vision_vec = average(mission_vec_role, vision_vec_role)
values_causes_vec = average(values_vec_role, causes_vec_vec)
role_query_vec = normalize( a*role_skill_vec + b*mission_vision_vec + c*values_causes_vec )
```
Defaults: a=0.6, b=0.3, c=0.1.
Query ANN index to fetch TopK (e.g., 500) candidate IDs.

## Stage-2: Precise multi-objective re-rank
For each candidate from Stage-1, compute:

### 4.1 SkillScore
Let role required skills R, nice skills N, candidate skills C.

Per required skill `r`:
```
best_match = argmax_{c∈C} [adjacency_factor(r,c) * level_fit(c,r)]
level_fit(c,r) = min(level_c / level_req_r, 1)

per_match_score = adjacency_factor * level_fit * recency_multiplier_c * evidence_strength_c * (0.5 + 0.5*impact_score_c)
```
Aggregate:
```
Coverage_req = Σ_r (w_r * per_match_score_r) / Σ_r w_r
Coverage_nice = Σ_n (w_n * per_match_score_n) / Σ_n w_n
SkillScore = 0.7*Coverage_req + 0.3*Coverage_nice
```

### 4.2 MissionValuesScore (MVV)
```
mission_sim = cosine(candidate.mission_vec, role.mission_vec)
vision_sim  = cosine(candidate.vision_vec,  role.vision_vec)

tag_overlap = Jaccard_with_synonyms( (values ∪ causes)_candidate , (values ∪ causes)_role )

### 4.3 PracticalFitScore
```
comp_score = sigmoid( k * (budget_mid - comp_target) / max(budget_mid, ε) )    // ~1 if target ≤ mid
avail_score = overlap_bits(candidate.availability, role.required_availability)  // [0..1]

dist_score  = (role.setting in {onsite, hybrid})
              ? exp( - km(candidate.geo, role.geo) / R ) : 1

            : (candidate.wish_sponsor && role.can_sponsor) ? 0.7 : 1
benef_score = match_ratio(role.benefits_required, candidate.benefits_offered)   // [0,1]

PracticalFitScore = w_comp*comp_score + w_avail*avail_score + w_tz*tz_score +

```
Defaults: `w_comp .25, w_avail .2, w_tz .1, w_dist .2 (onsite/hybrid else 0), w_lang .15, w_auth .1, w_benef .05`.

### 4.4 Total score + fairness caps
```
Total = W_skill*SkillScore + W_mvv*MissionValuesScore + W_prac*PracticalFitScore
// default: W_skill .55, W_mvv .25, W_prac .20

// fairness caps
Total = cap_component_contributions(Total, per_component_cap=0.6)
// optional: add small exploration noise to near-ties for exposure diversity
```

Return TopN with explanations.

# 5) Explanations & privacy redaction
- Build **top driver** list from each component: matched L4s & levels, adjacency notes, mission/tag matches, practical hits/misses.
- Respect **visibility flags**: if a role field is sensitive, the explainer uses a generic label (e.g., “confidential requirement met”) and omits raw value. Keep a **redaction log** for audit.

Example explanation item:
```
[
 {type:"skills", detail:"7/9 required L4s met (K8s C4, Postgres C4…); 2 adjacent via L3; recency strong (avg 0.78)"},
 {type:"mission", detail:"Mission cosine 0.82; shared causes: 'digital inclusion', 'open education'"},
 {type:"practical", detail:"Comp target 55k within 50–60k; 100% availability overlap; hybrid commute 14 km; sponsorship available & requested; benefits: health+dental matched"}
]

# 8) Indexing & freshness
- Recompute candidate vectors on profile edits; upsert ANN index entry within seconds.  
- Nightly jobs to:
  - decay recency (increment months_since_last_used),
  - refresh exchange rates (comp normalization),
  - rebuild ANN if schema/embeddings update.

# 9) Telemetry & evaluation
- **Quality**: Acceptance@K, Response-rate@K, Time-to-fill, 30/90-day retention.
- **Fairness**: exposure parity by non-sensitive cohorts (seniority bands, regions, first-seen vs later).  
- **System**: ANN latency p95, re-rank CPU time, index staleness.

# 10) MVP → Production path
- **MVP (no vectors)**: SQL filter + trigram keyword on mission/vision + deterministic skill coverage (exact codes only).  
- **Recommended**: Add embeddings + adjacency graph; keep rules as guardrails.  
- **Phase 2**: Pairwise learning-to-rank on feedback events; keep weights bounded and auditable.

---

If you want, I can generate:
- Drizzle schema snippets for the new fields/tables,
- a ready-to-paste `matchRole.ts` with the scoring functions,
- and seed **policy.yaml** + unit tests (golden examples) to validate scoring behavior on synthetic profiles.

User:
amazing. now explain this engine logic to a middle-schooler in a way that this middle schooler would be able to retell it to a senior developer and he would understand what it means

Assistant:
Here’s the “explain-it-like-I’m-12” version that a senior dev will still nod at:

# The big idea
It’s a **smart matcher for work**. Think “dating app,” but for people and assignments. It looks at three things, mixes them with set percentages, and gives each match a score.

**Final score = Skills (≈55%) + Mission/Values (≈25%) + Practical fit (≈20%).**

# What goes in
- **People profiles:** a big **skill tree** (L1→L4 codes), each L4 with level (C1–C5), proof, recency, and impact; plus mission & vision text, values & causes tags, location, time, pay target, languages, visa needs, benefits.
- **Assignments:** the same kinds of things, plus required & nice-to-have L4s (with levels), budget, work setting, time, languages, sponsorship ability, and any “secret fields” marked as private.

# How it decides (3 mini-scores)
1) **Skills score (≈55%)**  
   - Checks how many **required** and **nice** L4s you match.  
   - If you don’t have the exact L4, it can give a smaller credit for **nearby** skills in the tree (same L3/L2/L1 = “adjacent”).  
   - Better **level**, fresh **recency**, and stronger **proof/impact** raise the score.

2) **Mission/Values score (≈25%)**  
   - Compares the **meaning** of mission/vision texts (similarity).  
   - Counts overlap in **values/causes** tags (from a fixed list).

3) **Practical fit (≈20%)**  
   - Do the **hours** line up? Are you in the right **time zone**?  
   - Is the **pay** close enough? Remote vs **hybrid/onsite** distance ok?  
   - **Language** requirements met? **Visa** situation compatible?  
   - Optional **benefits** match (insurance, equity, etc.).

# The order of operations (how it runs)
1) **Hard gates first** (cheap checks): e.g., must-have language, no sponsorship possible when needed, totally out-of-range budget (if policy says so).  
2) **Fast search** to find likely people quickly: it builds a “meaning vector” from the assignment (skills + mission + tags) and pulls ~500 best candidates from a vector index.  
3) **Precise re-rank**: for those 500, it calculates the three mini-scores carefully (skills, mission/values, practical), combines them with the weights, and sorts.  
4) **Explain the result**: “Matched 7/9 required skills at level; mission similarity high; full availability overlap; commute 14 km,” etc.  
5) **Respect secrets**: fields marked **private** still affect the score but won’t be shown in explanations (“confidential criterion met”).  
6) **Learn later**: track accepts/rejects; later we can train a learning-to-rank model—but the rule/weight system stays as guardrails.

# Safety & fairness
- No single part can dominate the score (there’s a **cap** per component).  
- Near-ties can get a tiny shuffle so the same types don’t always show first.  
- All weights live in a **config file** so orgs can tweak policy safely.

# Why this works (in one line)
It finds good candidates fast by meaning, then scores them carefully on **skills**, **shared purpose**, and **real-life logistics**, tells you **why**, hides what’s **sensitive**, and is easy to **tune** later.
