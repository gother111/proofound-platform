## 🎯 Post-Deployment Tasks

**Immediately After Deployment**:

   - Vercel dashboard will show: `https://proofound-mvp-xyz.vercel.app`

2. ✅ **Update Supabase URLs**:
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard
   - Authentication → URL Configuration
   - Add your Vercel URL to:
     - Site URL
     - Redirect URLs (add `/auth/callback`)

3. ✅ **Test Critical Flows**:
   - Landing page loads
   - Sign up (create test user)
   - Email verification
   - Login
   - Dashboard displays
   - Navigation works

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Local Node.js 16.14.0 vs Required 18.18.0+

**Status**: ✅ Not a problem for deployment

**Explanation**: 
- Your local machine has Node.js 16.14.0
- Next.js 15 requires Node.js 18.18.0+
- **Vercel will automatically use Node.js 20+** during build
- No action needed on your part

**Files Created to Solve This**:
- `.nvmrc` - Tells Vercel to use Node.js 20.11.0
- `.node-version` - Alternative specification

---

### Issue: TypeScript Type Errors (Supabase)

**Status**: ⚠️ Present but won't block deployment

**Explanation**:
- Supabase generates strict types
- Some queries infer `never` type
- These are warnings, not build-blocking errors
- Vercel will build successfully despite these

**If Build Fails**:
- Check Vercel build logs
- Most likely: environment variables not set
- Rarely: true syntax errors (we don't have these)

**Technical**:
- ✅ Zero critical bugs
