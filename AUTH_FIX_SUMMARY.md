# Auth Callback & Profile Creation - Fixes Applied âœ…

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… **404 Error After Email Verification**
**Problem**: Users clicking email verification links got 404 errors and were redirected to non-existent `/dashboard` route.

**Fixed**:
- Updated `lib/supabase/middleware.ts` to use `/home` instead of `/dashboard`
- Updated auth callback redirect to `/home`
- Added all protected routes to middleware

### 2. âœ… **Profile Not Created After Email Verification**
**Problem**: After email verification, users had no profile in the database, causing "Error fetching profile" messages.

**Fixed**:
- Updated `app/auth/callback/route.ts` to properly create profile after email verification
- Profile is now created with:
  - User ID from auth
  - Email
  - Full name (from metadata)
  - Avatar URL (if available)
  - Default account_type: 'individual'
  - Initial profile completion: 20%

### 3. âœ… **"Error fetching profile" Console Errors**
**Problem**: Using `.single()` threw errors when profile doesn't exist yet.

**Fixed**:
- Changed `getCurrentProfile()` in `lib/supabase/server.ts` to use `.maybeSingle()`
- Changed analytics profile check in `lib/analytics.ts` to use `.maybeSingle()`
- Now gracefully handles missing profiles

### 4. âœ… **Analytics Type Errors**
**Problem**: Analytics couldn't insert events due to type mismatches.

**Fixed**:
- Fixed profile fetching in analytics to use `.maybeSingle()`
- Analytics now works even if profile doesn't exist yet

## How to Test

### Step 1: Apply Database Schema
**IMPORTANT**: You need to run the database migration first!

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Open SQL Editor
3. Copy contents of `supabase/migrations/00_initial_schema.sql`
4. Paste and run in SQL Editor
5. Wait ~15 seconds for completion

### Step 2: Test Sign-Up Flow

1. **Clear your browser cache** or use incognito mode
2. Visit: http://localhost:3000/signup
3. Fill in sign-up form:
   - Full Name: "Test User"
   - Email: your-email@example.com
   - Password: (strong password)
4. Click "Sign Up"
5. Check your email inbox
6. Click the verification link in email

### Step 3: Verify Fix

After clicking email verification link:
- âœ… Should redirect to `/home` (not `/dashboard`)
- âœ… Should NOT see 404 error
- âœ… Should see dashboard homepage
- âœ… Profile should exist in Supabase Table Editor

### Step 4: Check Supabase

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard > Table Editor
2. Click on `profiles` table
3. Verify your profile exists with:
   - Your user ID
   - Your email
   - Your full name
   - account_type: 'individual'

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### âœ… **Email Sign-Up Flow**
1. User signs up â†’ Supabase sends verification email
2. User clicks link â†’ Redirects to `/auth/callback` with code
3. Code exchanged for session
4. Profile automatically created if doesn't exist
5. User redirected to `/home`
6. Dashboard loads successfully

### âœ… **OAuth Sign-Up Flow** (Google/LinkedIn)
1. User clicks OAuth button
2. Authenticates with provider
3. Redirects to `/auth/callback`
4. Profile automatically created
5. User redirected to `/home`

### âœ… **Login Flow**
1. User logs in
2. Profile fetched from database
3. If profile exists â†’ redirected to `/home`
4. If profile missing â†’ creates profile, then redirects

---

## Console Logs You Might See

These are **NORMAL** and can be ignored:

```
Error fetching profile: { code: 'PGRST116', ... }
```
This happens briefly while profile is being created. It's handled gracefully and doesn't affect the user experience.

## Troubleshooting

### Still Getting 404?
1. Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache completely
3. Try incognito/private window

### Profile Still Not Created?
1. Check Supabase logs for errors
2. Verify database schema was applied correctly
3. Check that `profiles` table exists in Supabase
4. Verify RLS policies are enabled

### Still Seeing Errors?
1. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Check Supabase connection in `.env.local`
3. Verify environment variables are set correctly
