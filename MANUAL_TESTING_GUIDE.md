# üß™ Manual Testing Guide

This living guide walks you through every Proofound flow so you can confirm the redesigned experience still works end to end.

## Prerequisites & Environment

- ü™Ñ DO THIS MANUALLY: In your terminal run `npm install` (first time) and `npm run dev` (every session). The development server must stay on during testing.
- Supabase project configured with the latest migrations and policies from `src/db/*`.
- Resend (or another email provider) set up so verification and reset links arrive.
- Browser with private/incognito mode for clean sessions (Chrome preferred).

## Test Accounts & Naming

- Use repeatable emails like `test-individual-1@example.com`, `test-org-owner@example.com`, `test-org-invitee@example.com`.
- Passwords must be at least 8 characters; store them in your secure notes so you can reuse accounts.
- Keep a persona cheat-sheet while testing:
  - `individual` ‚Üí lands in `/app/i/*` routes.
  - `org_member` ‚Üí lands in `/app/o/<slug>/*` routes.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ UI & Visual QA (Figma Alignment)

- [ ] TopBar: square logo, separator, search, customize button, avatar with forest palette.
- [ ] LeftNav: matches icon order, hover background `rgba(232, 230, 221, 0.5)`, active background `#1C4D3A`.
- [ ] Dashboard cards: border `rgba(232, 230, 221, 0.6)`, buttons sized `h-7 text-xs`, hover color `#2D5F4A`.
- [ ] Parchment background `#F7F6F1` across `/app/i/*` and `/app/o/*` layouts.
- [ ] Dark mode: toggle via Zen Hub and confirm other pages still look correct when `class="dark"` is on `<html>`.
- [ ] Animations: framer-motion transitions feel smooth (no jump cuts).

### Loading & Empty States

- [ ] Skeletons or ‚ÄúLoading‚Ä¶‚Äù placeholders show during fetches on matching and assignments.
- [ ] Empty states include contextual CTAs (‚ÄúStart exploring‚Äù, ‚ÄúCreate assignment‚Äù).
- [ ] Error toasts appear if API calls fail (simulate network offline in DevTools).

### Responsive Checks

- [ ] 375px mobile: LeftNav collapses behind the menu button, cards stack vertically.
- [ ] 768px tablet: Two-column grids shrink gracefully, typography remains legible.
- [ ] 1440px desktop: Cards align to the 3-column grid, no unexpected whitespace.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Performance & Observability

- [ ] Home pages load < 1s on warm reload; note any slow cards.
- [ ] Profile and matching pages load < 2s; watch for slow SQL in Supabase logs.
- [ ] Network tab: verify no 4xx/5xx responses, check for unnecessary repeated calls.
- [ ] Console: ensure zero warnings/errors in happy paths.
- [ ] Monitor `matches` and `assignments` API latency (goal < 500ms).

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Database Verification Queries

Run these in the Supabase SQL editor (replace placeholders as needed):

### Individual Profile Completion

```sql
SELECT p.id,
       p.handle,
       p.persona,
       ip.headline,
       ip.values,
       ip.causes
FROM profiles p
LEFT JOIN individual_profiles ip ON ip.user_id = p.id
WHERE p.handle = 'test-individual-1';
```

Expected ‚úÖ: Persona = `individual`, values/causes populated after onboarding.

### Matching Preferences & Skills

```sql
SELECT mp.profile_id,
       mp.city,
       mp.work_mode,
       mp.comp_min,
       json_agg(json_build_object('skill', s.skill_id, 'level', s.level)) AS skills
FROM matching_profiles mp
LEFT JOIN skills s ON s.profile_id = mp.profile_id
WHERE mp.profile_id = '<profile_id>'
GROUP BY mp.profile_id;
```

Expected ‚úÖ: Preferences saved; skill list matches wizard input.

### Organization Creation & Membership

```sql
SELECT o.id,
       o.slug,
       o.display_name,
       om.user_id,
       om.role
FROM organizations o
LEFT JOIN organization_members om ON om.org_id = o.id
WHERE o.slug = 'test-org-1';
```

Expected ‚úÖ: At least one membership with role `owner`.

### Assignments and Match Cache

```sql
SELECT a.id,
       a.role,
       a.status,
       a.must_have_skills,
       COUNT(m.id) AS match_count
FROM assignments a
LEFT JOIN matches m ON m.assignment_id = a.id
WHERE a.org_id = '<org_id>'
GROUP BY a.id;
```

Expected ‚úÖ: New assignment shows `status = 'draft'` or `active`, and match_count reflects generated matches.

### Invitation Lifecycle

```sql
SELECT token,
       email,
       role,
       expires_at,
       accepted_at
FROM org_invitations
WHERE email = 'test-org-invitee@example.com'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

Expected ‚úÖ: `accepted_at` (or membership row) is populated after accepting.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Error & Edge-Case Scenarios

- Duplicate email/handle/slug should show inline validation instantly.
- Submit onboarding with missing required fields ‚Üí expect helpful errors.
- Attempt to access `/app/o/other-org/home` as a non-member ‚Üí expect redirect or 403 page.
- Trigger rate limiting by rapid login attempts (observe graceful error rather than crash).
- Disable network mid-submit to confirm retry or error toast behavior.

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Reporting Issues

Whenever you spot a bug:

1. Capture the exact reproduction steps.
2. Grab console errors (copy the stack) and failed network payloads.
3. Run the relevant SQL query above to record database state before/after.
4. Take screenshots or short Looms (especially for visual mismatches).
5. File an issue with expected vs actual behavior plus environment details.

‚úÖ When every checklist above passes (or issues are logged with owners), the release candidate is ready for manual sign-off!
