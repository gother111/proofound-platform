# Optional override for OAuth/email callback target (use when previews should redirect to production).
# You can supply either the base domain (e.g., https://proofound.io) or the full callback URL
# (e.g., https://project.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback). To support multiple domains, separate
# entries with commas or new lines; the value matching the current host is preferred.
#
# ⚠️ For Google sign-in, Supabase always calls back to https://<your-project>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback.
# Make sure that exact URL is listed under **Authorized redirect URIs** in your Google Cloud OAuth
# credentials, otherwise Google will reject the flow with `redirect_uri_mismatch`.
